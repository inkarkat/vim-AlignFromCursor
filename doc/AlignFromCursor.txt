DESCRIPTION					 *AlignFromCursor-description*

This plugin offers commands and mappings that align only the text to the right
of the cursor, and keep the text to the left unmodified, unlike the built-in
|:left| and |:right|, which always work on the entire line.
This is useful e.g. for right-aligning the "-- Author" attribution in a
fortune, the help tags definitions in this help file, or to left-align a
comment to a particular column.
The alignment width defaults to 'textwidth', can be passed as a [count] to the
mappings, and there are mappings that take the actual width from adjacent
previous / next lines.

RELATED WORKS								     *

- The Align plugin (vimscript #294) offers a general-purpose :Align command
  and many mappings for text alignment along various characters, but those are
  more specialized for certain syntax fragments and do not consider the
  current cursor position like this plugin.
- The Tabular plugin (https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular) is similar to the
  Align plugin.
- The vim-easy-align plugin (vimscript #4520) is also similar to Align, and
  asserts it's easy to use.
- right_align (vimscript #3728) has a :RightAlign command that aligns to
  'textwidth' in full increments of 'shiftwidth'.

USAGE						       *AlignFromCursor-usage*
			    *<Leader>le* *v_<Leader>le* *:LeftAlignFromCursor*
[width]<Leader>le
:[range]LeftAlignFromCursor [width]
			Left-align the text on and right of the cursor to
			[width] columns (default 'textwidth' or 80 when
			'textwidth' is 0). Cp. |:left|.
			Applies to all lines in [range], based on the current
			cursor position.
			In visual mode: Applies to the selected text, based on
			the leftmost selected column.
		       *<Leader>lp* *<Leader>ln* *v_<Leader>lp* *v_<Leader>ln*
[count]<Leader>lp	Left-align the text on and right of the cursor to the
[count]<Leader>ln	indent of the [count]'th previous / next unfolded line.
			In visual mode: Left-align the selected text to the
			indent of the [count]'th unfolded line above / below
			the visual selection.


			   *<Leader>ri* *v_<Leader>ri* *:RightAlignFromCursor*
[width]<Leader>ri
:[range]RightAlignFromCursor [width]
			Right-align the text on and right of the cursor to
			[width] columns (default 'textwidth' or 80 when
			'textwidth' is 0). Cp. |:right|.
			Applies to all lines in [range], based on the current
			cursor position.
			In visual mode: Applies to the selected text, based on
			the leftmost selected column.
		       *<Leader>rp* *<Leader>rn* *v_<Leader>rp* *v_<Leader>rn*
[count]<Leader>rp	Right-align the text on and right of the cursor to the
[count]<Leader>rn	width of the [count]'th previous / next unfolded line.
			In visual mode: Right-align the selected text to the
			width of the [count]'th unfolded line above / below
			the visual selection.

INSTALLATION					*AlignFromCursor-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim AlignFromCursor*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					*AlignFromCursor-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.016 or
  higher.
- IndentTab.vim (vimscript #3848) plugin (optional)
- repeat.vim (vimscript #2136) plugin (optional)
- visualrepeat.vim (vimscript #3848) plugin (optional)

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				       *AlignFromCursor-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
						       *AlignFromCursor-remap*
If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the
<Plug>(Left|Right)Align... mapping targets _before_ sourcing the script (e.g.
in your |vimrc|): >
    nmap <silent> <Leader>ri <Plug>RightAlignFromCursor
    nmap <silent> <Leader>le <Plug>LeftAlignFromCursor
    xmap <silent> <Leader>ri <Plug>RightAlignFromCursor
    xmap <silent> <Leader>le <Plug>LeftAlignFromCursor
    nmap <silent> <Leader>rp <Plug>RightAlignToPreviousLine
    nmap <silent> <Leader>rn <Plug>RightAlignToNextLine
    nmap <silent> <Leader>lp <Plug>LeftAlignToPreviousLine
    nmap <silent> <Leader>ln <Plug>LeftAlignToNextLine
    xmap <silent> <Leader>rp <Plug>RightAlignToPreviousLine
    xmap <silent> <Leader>rn <Plug>RightAlignToNextLine
    xmap <silent> <Leader>lp <Plug>LeftAlignToPreviousLine
    xmap <silent> <Leader>ln <Plug>LeftAlignToNextLine

IDEAS						       *AlignFromCursor-ideas*

HISTORY						     *AlignFromCursor-history*

2.02	RELEASEME
- Improve internal efficiency.
- Extract AlignFromCursor#GetRetabbedFromCol() and expose for reuse.

2.01	29-Jan-2014
- Support the IndentTab setting provided by the optional IndentTab plugin
  (vimscript #4243). I.e. align with spaces when there's text before the
  cursor.
  *** You need to update to ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.016! ***

2.00	19-Jul-2013
- Use unfolded lines for the relative [count] in <Leader>lp / <Leader>ln /
  <Leader>rp / <Leader>rn. This is consistent with other Vim commands and
  allows benefitting from 'relativenumber'. When addressing a folded line, the
  indent of the first contained line is used.
- ENH: Add visual mode <Leader>lp / <Leader>ln / <Leader>rp / <Leader>rn
  mappings that work on the selection and take the [count]'th above / below
  line.
- CHG: Make repeats of the mappings use the previous width instead of just
  re-applying them at the current cursor position. DWIM.
- BUG: Don't delete whitespace immediately after the cursor position if the
  cursor rests on a non-whitespace character. This makes the alignment _after_
  the cursor position, not _from_ it. (Though this was a nice DWIM feature
  when on the last character of a word; but it makes it impossible to do an
  actual align from there, and is inconsistent.)
- Add dependency to ingo-library (vimscript #4433). *** You need to separately
  install ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.004 (or higher)! ***

1.12	10-Jan-2013
Fix slowness of :RightAlignFromCursor in connection with plugins like
recover.vim, caused by the repeated triggers of InsertEnter / InsertLeave
events inserting a single space.

1.11	06-Dec-2012
BUG: On repeat, the original [count] is overridden by the align commands,
causing e.g. a toggling of right-align and align to column 1 on repeated
<Leader>ri.

1.10	02-Aug-2012
ENH: Do not :retab the entire line (which also affects leading indent and
whitespace after the area, just render the modified whitespace around the
cursor according to the buffer's indent settings.

1.00	01-Aug-2012
First published version.

0.01	22-Jul-2006
Started development.
