DESCRIPTION					 *AlignFromCursor-description*

This plugin offers commands and mappings that align only the text to the right
of the cursor, and keep the text to the left unmodified, unlike the built-in
|:left| and |:right|, which always work on the entire line.
This is useful e.g. for right-aligning the "-- Author" attribution in a
fortune, the help tags definitions in this help file, or to left-align a
comment to a particular column.
The alignment width defaults to 'textwidth', can be passed as a [count] to the
mappings, and there are mappings that take the actual width from adjacent
previous / next lines.

RELATED WORKS								     *

- The Align plugin (vimscript #294) offers a general-purpose :Align command
  and many mappings for text alignment along various characters, but those are
  more specialized for certain syntax fragments and do not consider the
  current cursor position like this plugin.
- The Tabular plugin (https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular) is similar to the
  Align plugin.

HISTORY						     *AlignFromCursor-history*

1.11	06-Dec-2012
BUG: On repeat, the original [count] is overridden by the align commands,
causing e.g. a toggling of right-align and align to column 1 on repeated
<Leader>ri.

1.10	02-Aug-2012
ENH: Do not :retab the entire line (which also affects leading indent and
whitespace after the area, just render the modified whitespace around the
cursor according to the buffer's indent settings.

1.00	01-Aug-2012
First published version.

0.01	22-Jul-2006
